# Kommito

Kommito is a lightweight version control system inspired by Git, built as a fun learning project to understand the internals of version control systems. It implements core Git concepts in a simplified way while maintaining a clean, modular architecture.

> üéÆ **Personal Project**: This is a fun side project I built to learn about version control systems. Just sharing my learning journey!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Development Status**: This project is in active development as I learn and experiment. Features are added as I explore different aspects of version control systems.

## Why Kommito?

I built Kommito to:

- Learn and understand the fundamental concepts of version control systems
- Implement Git-like functionality in a simplified manner
- Have fun experimenting with file system operations and data structures
- Challenge myself to build something complex from scratch

## Core Features

Kommito provides essential version control features:

1. **Repository Management**

   - Initialize new repositories
   - Track file changes
   - Maintain commit history
   - Manage file versions
   - Clone existing repositories (both Kommito and Git)

2. **File Operations**

   - Stage individual files
   - Track file modifications
   - Store file contents efficiently
   - Skip system files automatically
   - Handle file content hashing

3. **Commit System**

   - Create commits with messages
   - Track commit history
   - Maintain commit metadata
   - Automatic author detection
   - Timestamp tracking

4. **Status and History**

   - View repository status
   - Check staged changes
   - Display commit history
   - Show file modifications
   - Track untracked files

5. **Branch Management**
   - Create new branches
   - Switch between branches
   - List all branches
   - Delete branches
   - Track current branch

## Project Structure

```
kommito/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/           # Internal packages
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ repo/          # Core repository operations
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ objects.go  # Object storage handling
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commit.go   # Commit operations
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.go    # Staging area management
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clone.go    # Repository cloning
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ log.go      # Commit history
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ status.go   # Repository status
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ branch.go   # Branch management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go            # CLI entry point
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod             # Go module definition
```

## Repository Structure

When you initialize a Kommito repository, it creates the following structure:

```
.kommito/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ objects/           # Object storage
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blobs/        # File contents (SHA-1 hashed)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ commits/      # Commit objects (JSON format)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ refs/             # References
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ heads/        # Branch references
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HEAD              # Points to current commit
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index            # Staging area
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json      # Repository configuration
```

## Implementation Details

### Object Storage System

1. **Blob Objects**

   - Store actual file contents
   - Named using SHA-1 hash of content
   - Located in `.kommito/objects/blobs/`

2. **Commit Objects**
   - Store commit metadata in JSON format
   - Include author, timestamp, and message
   - List of blob references
   - Located in `.kommito/objects/commits/`

### Data Structures

```go
// Commit structure
type Commit struct {
    Author    string   `json:"author"`     // Commit author
    Timestamp string   `json:"timestamp"`  // Commit timestamp
    Message   string   `json:"message"`    // Commit message
    Blobs     []string `json:"blobs"`      // Referenced blob hashes
}

// Branch structure
type Branch struct {
    Name   string `json:"name"`   // Branch name
    Commit string `json:"commit"` // Latest commit hash
}
```

## Usage Guide

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Initialize a new repository
kommito init

# Stage files
kommito add <file>    # Stage a single file
kommito add .         # Stage all files in current directory

# Create a commit
kommito commit -m "Your commit message"

# View commit history
kommito log

# Check repository status
kommito status

# Clone a repository
kommito clone <source> <destination>  # Clone local Kommito repo
kommito clone <git-url> <destination> # Clone Git repo

# Branch management
kommito branch list              # List all branches
kommito branch create <name>     # Create a new branch
kommito branch switch <name>     # Switch to a branch
kommito branch delete <name>     # Delete a branch

# Merge branches
kommito merge <branch>           # Merge a branch into the current branch

# Checkout/Restore
kommito checkout <commit-or-branch> # Restore working directory to a commit or branch
```

### Workflow Examples

1. **Start a New Project**

   ```bash
   mkdir my-project
   cd my-project
   kommito init
   ```

2. **Add and Track Files**

   ```bash
   echo "# My Project" > README.md
   kommito add README.md
   kommito commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

3. **Work with Branches**

   ```bash
   kommito branch create feature
   kommito branch switch feature
   # Make changes
   kommito add .
   kommito commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```

4. **Clone an Existing Repository**

   ```bash
   # Clone a local Kommito repository
   kommito clone /path/to/repo my-clone

   # Clone a Git repository
   kommito clone https://github.com/user/repo.git my-clone
   ```

## User Experience & CLI

- **Clear CLI commands:** All commands are available with `kommito --help` and subcommand help (e.g., `kommito commit --help`).
- **Good error messages:** The CLI provides clear, user-friendly error messages and feedback for all operations.
- **Intuitive workflow:** Commands and options are designed to be familiar to users of Git and other VCS tools.
- **Emoji-based status indicators:** Fun, friendly feedback in the terminal.

## Data Integrity

- **Content-addressed storage:** All file contents (blobs) and commit objects are stored using their SHA-1 hash, ensuring that data is uniquely and reliably identified.
- **Commit and branch safety:** HEAD and branch references (refs) are always updated correctly during commit, branch, merge, and checkout operations, so the repository state is always consistent.
- **No data loss:** All operations are designed to avoid data loss during normal use. Files are only removed or overwritten as part of explicit user actions (e.g., checkout, merge with conflict resolution).
- **Atomic operations:** Writes to the repository are performed atomically to prevent corruption or partial updates.

## Edge Case Handling

- **Cannot delete current branch:** The system prevents deletion of the branch you are currently on, protecting your work.
- **Cannot merge branch into itself:** Merging a branch into itself is not allowed, avoiding unnecessary or confusing operations.
- **Handles missing files gracefully:** Commands check for missing files and provide clear error messages without crashing.
- **Warns on uncommitted changes:** (If implemented) The system can warn you if you have uncommitted changes before switching branches or checking out a commit, helping prevent accidental data loss.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **File Operations**: Go standard library (`os`, `io`)
- **Hashing**: SHA-1 for content addressing
- **Data Storage**: JSON for metadata
- **Error Handling**: Custom error types and messages
- **CLI Framework**: Cobra for command-line interface

### Key Features

1. **Atomic Operations**

   - Safe file writes
   - Transaction-like commits
   - Error recovery

2. **Efficient Storage**

   - Content-based addressing
   - Deduplication of content
   - JSON-based metadata storage

3. **User Experience**

   - Simple command interface
   - Clear error messages
   - Intuitive workflow
   - Emoji-based status indicators

4. **Git Compatibility**
   - Clone Git repositories
   - Convert Git history
   - Preserve file structure

## Building and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher
- Git (for version control and cloning)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Kshitijknk07/Kommito.git
cd Kommito

# Build the project
go build

# Run directly
go run main.go
```

### Important Notes

1. **Current Limitations**
   - Basic version control features only
   - No remote repository support
   - Edge case protections are in place for branch deletion, merging, and file handling
   - Built for learning purposes only
   -
